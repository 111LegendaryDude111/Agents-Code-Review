# AI Code Reviewer

## About the Project
AI Code Reviewer is an automated code review tool leveraging Artificial Intelligence (LLM) capabilities. It integrates into CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) and assists in conducting high-quality analysis of changes in Pull Requests.

## Benefits
*   **Time Saving**: Automates routine code review tasks, allowing developers to focus on architecture and logic.
*   **Intelligent Analysis**: Uses modern LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama) for deep understanding of change context, finding issues missed by standard linters.
*   **Code Quality Improvement**: Identifies potential errors, vulnerabilities, and coding standard violations at early stages.
